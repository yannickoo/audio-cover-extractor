# Audio Cover Extractor

This small script extracts covers from all audio files in the `audio` directory.

## Installation
* Download [getID3()](http://sourceforge.net/projects/getid3/files/getID3%28%29%201.x/) into a `getid3` directory so that the path from `index.php` to the `getid3` is `getid3/getid3/getid3.php`.
* Make `audio` and `covers` directory writable.
* Just put your audio files into the `audio` directory and open the `index.php` file.
